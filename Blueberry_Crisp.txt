INGREDIENTS
	•	1 cup rolled oats
	•	1 cup pecan halves (about ¾ cup chopped)
	•	½ cup almond meal
	•	½ cup flaked coconut (unsweetened, preferably!)
	•	¼ teaspoon salt
	•	¼ teaspoon cinnamon
	•	¼ cup + 2 tablespoons olive oil
	•	⅓ cup real maple syrup or raw honey
	•	4 cups blueberries

INSTRUCTIONS
	1.	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Chop the pecans. Combine the oats, pecans, almond meal, coconut, salt, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Add the olive oil and maple syrup and stir until well mixed. GOOD LUCK NOT EATING THE WHOLE THING RIGHT HERE AND NOW.
	2.	Grease a square baking dish (8x8 or 9x9) and arrange the blueberries in the bottom. Top with the oat mixture. Bake for 25-35 minutes or until the top is golden brown and has firmed up slightly. If you want, you can top with additional flaked coconut and return to the oven for another 5 minutes just for some decorative toasted coconut on top.
